            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>O to then, and let vs launch further with good lucke, paynting out with penne, and relating with tong, the places of pleasure and inestimable delightes, which are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed abroad, to be in <hi>Thessalia.</hi> For many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it is, that wordes, if they beare the badge of eloquence, and be ensigned with the cognisance of substanciall and pithy reasons, canne no lesse expresse a thing, before the eies of the people: thē y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> artificial fingers, and the sprinckling pencil of a cunning paynter, excelling in his profession, and singuler in his science. The places aboue specified, are, a percel of lande situate and lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene two mightie mountaines, namely, <hi>Olympus,</hi> and <hi>Ossa,</hi> whiche huge hils are of an vnaccustomable heigth, and separated the one from the other, by the wonderfull working of the euerlasting God, whose habitation is in heauen. Betwéen which two mountaines, as it were in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> midst, a plot of ground is incompassed, the length whereof ariseth by estimation to fortie furlongs, euery furlong containing the measure of a hundred twentie and fiue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the breadth in some places (but not in all) containing two hundred fortie and two foote, and in other some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces somewhat more. In this middle plot of grounde run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a riuer, called <hi>Penaus,</hi> into whose receptacle, other channels haue recourse, making the same a great floude, by the abundant streams which issueth into the bosome of the same. The place before rehearsed, is adorned &amp; decked with diuers goodly lodgings (as it were) &amp; harbours of all sortes, wonderfull workes not wrought with the handes of men, but framed by the predestination and foreappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lady Nature, which principall and preeminent priuiledges she bestowed therevpon, when the place was
<pb facs="tcp:176408:39"/> (as it were) in his infancie, &amp; had his original beginning. There groweth green Iuie most plentifully, there it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth most beautifully, there it créepeth vpwarde to the tops of tal trées, winding it selfe round about the barkes, imbracing the branches, &amp; springing about the body &amp; the armes of them, in the similitude &amp; likenes of most fruitful vines. There grow Yew trées abundantly, ouershadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gréen banks, wrapping themself round about the rocks, &amp; couering the stone, in such sort, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rocke is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither hidden, nothing perceiued but the fresh gréen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, glorious to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sight, &amp; sumptuous spectacles to delight the eye. In the field it self, &amp; the plain land, there be sundry gardens &amp; arbours of great compasse, pleasant Sommer parlours, and comfortable clossets of rest &amp; recreation for wayfaring mē, to be succoured in the hot season of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> yere, wherin they may conueniētly (as it were with restoritie) refresh their wery mēbers in their tedious &amp; combersome iourny. Through this goodly groūd, many cleere brookes &amp; holsome springs haue passage, whose water is cold, swéet, &amp; sauory to drink for the quenching of thirst. Some say, that such as wash their lims, &amp; bath their bodies in this water, reap an incomparable aduantage, for the maintenance of their healthfulnes, such singuler vertue is instilled from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, into the mylde &amp; gentle streams of the saide springs. Furthermore, braue birdes of sundry sorts, syt scattering here &amp; there, in diuers corners, singing most swéetly vpon the boughes, beautified w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> blossoms &amp; green leaues, &amp; speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such birds, whose chirping tongs &amp; whistling throats make such a musical sound, &amp; such tuneable harmony, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> delight proceding frō the same, &amp; pearcing into the eares ingender such an indefatigable delight in the mind, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> weary traueller forgetteth the tediousnes of his way, for so much as the lothsomnes of his labor is not only assua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but also abandoned. On both sides of the floud, are (as I haue already made rehearsal) places or rather pallaces of pleasure, garnished with notable delights, replenished
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176408:39"/> with renoumed recreation. Through the midst of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Paradise, the floud <hi>Peneus</hi> doth runne, sliding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a smothe and a calme streame, as it were slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie oyle, it is also ouershadowed with the boughes and branches of excellent trées, planted about the banks of the same, by the benefit wherof, the sun beames (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would cast a great heate) are kept from the superfice of the water the most part of the day, offering to such as saile that way, a temperate passage by reason of the ayre, which is moderately mixed with two contrary qualities. Besides the premisses, this in like manner is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the people bordering and inhabiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, make their accustomable conuents, their solemne sacrafices, their vsuall assemblies, and sumptuous bākets in those pleasant places. When therfore there be many to pay their oblations to the supernal gods, and to bestow their diligent labour, in the adoration and worshippe of them, &amp; in the accomplishment of sacred exercises, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that they preparing their passage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their progresse this way, eyther by lande or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by horse or by shippe, by waggon or any kynde of ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, seruing the necessitie of Nauigation, swéete smels, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous sauours are caried &amp; conueyed by the spireable ayre to their nostrils, seasoning the instrument of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of odoration, with the perfumes aboue specifyed.</p>
               <p>Thus the perpetual seruice exhibited to the gods, maketh the place, shal I say prophane? No, but holy and heauenly. The people of <hi>Thessalia</hi> reporte, that in this Paradise of pleasantnes, <hi>Apollo Pytheus</hi> was purged at the cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when he slue the Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> with his bowe and arrowes, kéeping as yet <hi>Delphos,</hi> the countrey hauing the Oracle, Being afterwardes crowned with a garlande of Lawrell leaues, whiche sprang in those moste pleasant Medowes aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and holding in his ryght hande a Boy braunche, and so came to <hi>Delphos,</hi> Finally, that he whiche discended
<pb facs="tcp:176408:40"/> of the loynes of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Latona,</hi> occupied the Oracle. There is also in the foresayde place, an Altar, where he was crowned, and tooke away the branch. And therefore the people of <hi>Delphos,</hi> euery nynth yeare ordinarily, send the yong sonnes of their nobilitie, accompanied with the principal superintendant, in diuine rites and sacred cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to those famous places in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> (of which the whole summe of this present treatise dependeth) who at their comming thither, execute diuine seruice with no lesse pompe and magnificence, than with deuotion and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, making garlandes of the Lawrell trée, which grew in that speciall place, whereof the louing God also (when time was) made him selfe a crowne, and so depart. In which returne of theirs, they followe the way, which is called <hi>Pythias,</hi> leading by <hi>Thessalia,</hi> into <hi>Pelagonia,</hi> into <hi>Oeta,</hi> into the region of the <hi>Aenians,</hi> the <hi>Melians,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and the <hi>Locrans Hesperij.</hi> The conducters also of the boyes, exhibite great honour and reuerence to the <hi>Hyperboreans,</hi> which bring oblations and sacrifices to the same God. And herevpon springeth this custome, that Lawrell garlandes are giuen to such as winne the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in these games and exercises which were solemnized in the renoume of <hi>Apollo,</hi> called <hi>Pythiorum spectacula.</hi> But of the terrestriall Paradise in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and of al the pleasures wherewith it is adorned, let this which I haue rehearsed, seeme sufficient.</p>

Furthermore that they are (as he reported infected with no sickenesses, molested with no disseases, nor vexed with any sorow, but that theyr whole life is a perpetual pleasure, a continuall delight, interlaced with laughters and disportes. Besides this that they are fauourers and supporterers of iustice, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of equitie, and mainteiners of vpright dealing, &amp; that the immortall gods, oftentimes kéepe them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, vouchsafeing to abase and conforme them selfe to their fellowship.

Golde and siluer is to them plentifull in possession, in so much that these metalles are of no more estimation with them then yron is in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and value among vs. Furthermore, he said, that they attempted vpon a time to inuade our Islandes, that ten thousandes of them had passed ouer the <hi>Ocean</hi> sea, and came as farre as the people <hi>Hiperborti,</hi> and hearing the report of the inhabitants of our land, that they were most religious, holy and deuout, they had them in contempte, detesting &amp; abhorring them as naughty people, of preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous properties, &amp; damnable behauiour, and for that cause interrupted their progresse, supposing it an enterprise of litle worthinesse or rather none at al, to trauaile into such
<pb facs="tcp:176408:47"/> a countrey. Furthermore he tolde one thing among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, meriting admiration, that certain men called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes</hi> dwelt in many cittyes ther about, and that in the borders adiacent to their countrey, was a perilous place named <hi>Anostus,</hi> that is to say, wythout returne, being a gaping gulfe, or bottomles pit, for the ground is as it were cleft and rent in sonder, in so much that it openeth like to the mouth of insatiable hell, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> it is neither perfectly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, nor absolutely darksome, but that the ayer hangeth ouer it, being tempered with a certaine kinde of clowdy rednes, that a couple of floodes fet their recourse that way, the one of pleasure the other of sorow, and that about each of them growe plantes answeareble in quantity and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to a great plaine trée. The trees which spring by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flood of sorow yeldeth fruite of one nature, qualitie, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if any man taste thereof, a streame of teares floweth from his eyes, as out of a conduite pipe, or sluse in a running riuer, yea, such effect followeth immediatly after the eating of the same, that the whole race of their life is turned into a tragical lamentation, in so much that wéeping and wayling knitteth their carkeses depriued of vitall mouing, in a winding shéete, and maketh them gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettes for the gréedy graue to swallow and deuoure. The other trées which prosper vpon the bankes of the floode of pleasure, beare fruite cleane contrary to the former, for whosoeuer tasteth thereof, he is presently weined from the pappes of his auncient appetites and inueterate desires, &amp; if he were linked in loue to any in time past, he is fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the forgetfulnes of them, so that al remembrance is quite abolished, by litle and litle he recouereth the yeres of his youth, reasuming vnto him by degrées, the times &amp; sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, long since, spent and gone.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first contention betwéene <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp; <hi>Plato,</hi> tooke original beginning herevpon. <hi>Plato</hi> disallowed <hi>Aristotles</hi> disordred life, the apparel which he did weare he could by no meanes approue, and his behauiour, as he thought, deserued much blame. For <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> (somewhat to touche his attire) trimmed himselfe with gorgeous garments, yea, the very shooes of his féete were costly and sumpteous, he vsed to shaue his head, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the custome of <hi>Plato,</hi> and vpon his fingers he did weare gimmalles, and golden rings beautified with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, for ostention sake, and vaine superfluous bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. Furthermore, his countenance was altogether giuen to quarreling, to scoffing, and to caueling: beside this, his vntimely tattling, wherein he passed the Parrat, the popingey, or the pie, discouered his cankard conditions &amp; corrupt inclination. That these things become not a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher it is as euident as the bright beames of the sonne at midde day, as also howe offensiue they were to such as framed their liues after their professiō it is marueilous manifest. For prudent <hi>Plato</hi> perceiuing and pondring <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi> demeanure, could not digest or brooke him in his brest, but set before him <hi>Xenocrates, Speusippus, Amiclas</hi> &amp; others, whom he had onely in estimation and reuerence, but also admitted them to be partakers of his desputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Vpon a time <hi>Xenocrates</hi> tooke a iournei into his own countrey, in whose absence, <hi>Aristotle</hi> with a company of his Disciples or schollers, (among whom was <hi>Mnason
<pb facs="tcp:176408:48"/> Phocensis,</hi> and diuers other) impugned and withstood <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> of purpose. At the same instant was <hi>Speusippus</hi> sicke, &amp; therfore could not conueniently be present with <hi>Plato,</hi> thē also was y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ancient Philosopher 80. yeres of age in so much that through méere extremitie of age the abilitie of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decayed in him, which did the more animate <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his madnes, and ministred audacity vnto him to assault olde <hi>Plato</hi> with Sophisticall conclusions, quarreling questions, and subtile argumentes which he tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with taunting tearmes, and carping language: by which circumstances he shewed plaine signes and tokens, not onely of iniury but also of ingratitude (&amp; the self same, not indifferent, but excessiue) cōmitted against so profound a Philosopher. <hi>Plato</hi> therefore auoided, and instituted his way directly to his owne house, hauing the company of his familiar friendes. After thrée monethes were expired and ended <hi>Xenocrates</hi> returned and found <hi>Aristotle</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp and downe, and teaching in the same place where he left <hi>Plato,</hi> at such time as he tooke his iourney, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing him with his complices and adherentes, so farre from folowing <hi>Plato,</hi> that they segregated themselues vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly from his assembly, and to haue a conuenticle of their owne, he demaunded of one in the place of exercises called <hi>Peripatum</hi> what was happened to <hi>Plato,</hi> and what was become of him? Answer was made, that he was not sicke, howbeit the occasion of his absence from hence procéeded of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who of late molested the man in such sort, &amp; was such an intollerable trouble vnto him, that he was fain of force to forsake <hi>Peripatum</hi> the place of his profession, &amp; at this present he is at his owne house, reading, teaching, and discoursing in Philosophie priuately in his garden. When <hi>Xenocrates</hi> had receiued this answer, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out any further interposition of talke, vpon a very sudden, prepared spéedy passage to <hi>Plato,</hi> whom he found (as it was reported) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with his auditory which were many in nomber, &amp; the self same of no small countenance, &amp; credit, and some of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176408:48"/> them also yong men descended of good degree &amp; in very wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shipful place. When <hi>Plato</hi> had finished his disputatiōs, he saluted <hi>Xenocrates</hi> most louingly, according to his accusto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med courtesie, and <hi>Xenocrates</hi> in lyke maner did the lyke to <hi>Plato.</hi> Anon, when the assemblye was broken vp &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> moued no cōmunication to <hi>Plato</hi> cōcer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the former matter, neither dyd <hi>Plato</hi> once make mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion thereof, nor called it in question. But gathering his companions togeather about him, first reprehended <hi>Speu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> sharply for geuing place to <hi>Aristotle</hi> in <hi>Peripato,</hi> and then consequently bent the mayne force of his mighte against him, contending with wordes, and withstanding his procéedings indéede insomuch y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the strife betwéene thē both waxed hot and fyery. In conclusion was kindled with such commotions of minde that he dispossessed <hi>Aristotle</hi> of the <hi>Peripatum,</hi> expelled and thrust him out by the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as obtayning that place by vsurpation, and therefore most worthy of dislocation: So that in fine, the deuine Philosopher <hi>Plato,</hi> that good olde man recouered his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed roome, and was (by compulsory meanes) restored to his proper place.</p>

But these enumerations following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue no shaddow nor cypher of commendation. First, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fifte day of one month (as the reporte runneth) hee drunk somuch at <hi>Eumeus</hi> Manour, that he was quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, sléeping out his beastly surfeiting all the sixt day folowing, wherin he did nothing at al in a maner, but rise a litle from his drunken pillow and gaue commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the morrowes voiage, saying, that it should be the next morning very early at the spring of the light from the East. The seauenth day folowing he feasted and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queted at the Lorde of <hi>Perdina</hi> his Pallace, at what time he pampered his paunche like an epicure, with choise of chéere, and change of wines, ouer drinking himselfe, in such insatiable sorte, that all the eight day next insueing was consumed in sléepe. Furthermore vpon the fiftéenth day of the same month he fell to winebibbing againe, and spent the next day after in sléepe to digest his surfeting. The foure and twenty day folowing he supped at <hi>Bago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> table, whose Manour, was distant from Courte, about a tenne furlongs, the second seruice of whose vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuse (swallowing wine as swine do their swill) was drowsines and sléepe, which folowed his intemperaunce, successiuely.

Yf a Straunger, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourner, was come amonge them, and entred into the soyle which they enhabited, a litle before the sunne setting, and was desirous to lodge in one mans house or other, if he were not receiued, intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and harboured, he or they, which neglected duty in this respect, payd an appointed penalty for their inhumanytie, and sustayned deserued punishment for their churlyshnesse. A Law (as it séemeth vnto mée) very profitable to the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man, and allowable to <hi>Iupiter</hi> the louer of hospy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talytie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dardane Illyrrians,</hi> vsed to washe and skoure their skinnes but thrée times in all their lyfe, namely, after their birth, at their marriage, and at their deathes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> put not their money to vsury, neither doe they receiue money to vsury. Because it is not lawfull that any <hi>Indian</hi> amonge them all should take wronge, or doe wrong. And therefore they make no bonds, no oblygations, nor hand writings to iustyfie any matter, neither doe they lay any thing to gage and to pledge.</p>
               <p>There is a Law obserued among the people <hi>Sordoi,</hi> that the sonnes sowse and thumpe their fathers being aged and weaklings, with clubs to the death, and after they haue slaine them in such sort, to prouide for the due execution of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176408:58"/> their funeralles, iudging it an absurd thing, and altogether repugnant to reason, that olde men should haue their liues prolonged, because that when their bodies be worne with multytude of yeares and imbecilytie, their wits are freshe and ripe to excogitate and deuise subtilties, crafts, deceipts, and mischiefes. The same people prouided by bréefe of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that slouthfulnesse, and ydlenesse, should be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with due punishment, and that such as lyued without labour, and shifted the world without taking paines, should render an accounts (narrow examination being prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) after what sort they liued, and whereuppon they were maintained.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Assyrians,</hi> when their virgins, and yong damoselles are of sufficient yeares and mariageable, they bring them altogeather into one Citie, and set them out to sale lyke wares in a common market, and euery man is wedded and bedded with her, as with his spouse legitimate, whom hee purchaseth with his penny.</p>
               <p>The people <hi>Biblij,</hi> if they sée any thing loste by the way, they take it not vp, because they layde it not downe. For if any infringed and brake the staffe of that Statute, they iudged the thing taken vp, not to be found, but rather to be stolne, and so hee or they that offended were atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of felony.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Berbicae</hi> kill and slay all that be aboue the age of thréescore and ten yeares, hacking and hewing their men, stranglyng and choking their women.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Colchi</hi> bury their dead in hydes and skinnes, sowing them vp close, and hanging them vpon trees.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lydyans</hi> vse and custome was, that women before they lay in bed with their husbandes, should lye open to be occupied, and hauing once had carnall knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the séede of generation, they should liue afterwardes chast and continent. And whatsoeuer she was that durste deale in fleshly delight with the body of any other, she should

               <p>Moreouer, the Citie <hi>Siracusae</hi> was defended, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancially maintained with very great hauens, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with high, mayne, and mighty wals.

This <hi>Aspasia</hi> when she was but a younge wenche and nothing néere womans estate, had rysen vnder her chinne a sore swelling, much lyke vnto a wenne, which was a meruelous deformity, and a disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to her faire and amiable countenaunce, an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of great gréefe to her father, and a prouocation of no lesse sorow to the tender maiden. Wherfore y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> careful &amp; louing man being desireous to haue his Daughter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from such a blemishe, brought her vnto a certain Surgeon to be cured, who after he had séene the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, to salue and handled the tumor with his fingers, promised vp the sore, and to heale it so perfectly, that all future inconueniences shoulde be preuented and no doubt of daunger remaine. Howbeit he made this couenaunt vppon condition, that vnto hym shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:176408:124"/> be payd the sum of thrée Staters, which kinde of poyse is by valluation the summe of six nobles of englishe coyne. The poore man making aunswere that hee had not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he demaunded, no more sayde the Surgion haue I further to deale with you younge daughters disease. Whereupon <hi>Aspasia</hi> conceiued such sorrow and anguish of hart, as the penne of this historiographer cannot suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently describe, nor the mindes of such as reade this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent declaration perfectly enough consider: in so much that she departing from thence home to her fathers house where her continuall abydinge was, wept, wayled, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and mourned, that great streames and riuers of teares gushed from her eyes, in which sorrowfull estate she tooke her looking glasse sundry and oftentimes, &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same in her lap, behelde the wenne which grewe by her throate, and pondring what a great stayne it was to her face, pitifully complained, as the swéet singing and siluer feathered Swanne, at the appropinquation and drawing néere of death: when as therefore she was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this perplexity, and drowned in the whirlpoole of hideous and gastly heauinesse, when I say the increase of her comfortlesse cogitations, and troublesome thoughts, did so sting her that she forsooke her ordinary sustenance, she fell into a déepe and dead sléepe (very luckely no doubt) and therewithall appeared vnto her a vision in the forme and figure of a Pigeon, which immediatly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his shape, and was transformed into the similitude of a woman, vttering these wordes to <hi>Aspasia,</hi> with a cléere and a swéete sounding voice. <hi>Bonum animum geras Aspasia, vale antque medici cum suis pharmacis: tu vero rosea serta veneris, que iam aruerint, cape, eaque contrita tuberi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone.</hi> Be of good chéere <hi>Aspasia,</hi> and let the Surgeons goe with their salues, their emplasters, their instruments ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for incision, and adustion: onely take thou the roses which are in the garlands dedicated to Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:176408:124"/> so they be dry and withered, bruse them and stampe them to pouder, and lay them to thy swelling. After <hi>Aspasia</hi> had heard these words of consolation, and had put that in experience which was reported vnto her by reuelation, the wenue consumed, and vanished away, and was no more perceiued then a trembling starre when the bright and glittering sunne shineth in scortching <hi>Cancro,</hi> then a pale primerose or purple violet among high Elmes and Okes, then a litle wren among great birds with spreding winges, then a young lambe among a thick flock of shéep, or a huge heard of tall stéeres, then a light wherry among a multitude of mighty Ships. Then was <hi>Aspasia</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in the number of beutifull and amiable maydens, and her comly countenance was couloured with crimson hew, which came to passe by and through the cōpassion &amp; clemēcie of Lady <hi>Venus,</hi> in somuch that (to acknowledge the manyfest truth) she looked so louingly, and glistered as it were, so gloriously that she had not her match aliue, but was singuler and incomparable: her haire was as yellow as Saffron, Cytron, or beaten Gold: her locks were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, crisped, friseled, and tusked: her eyes were great, gray, round, and rowling: her nose was white, smoth, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, slipperye, and crooked, her skinne soft as silke, and tender as carded wull: her eares short, thinne, prety, feat, fine, and proper: Finally her whole countenaunce, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, eilids, nose, chéeks, eares, lips, &amp; whatsoeuer els, was lyke the damaske rose sprinkled with morning dew. For which circumstaunces thin habitants of <hi>Phocis</hi> called her when shee was but an infant, and sucking babe, by the name of <hi>Milto:</hi> her lippes were bright sanguine red, her téeth as white as the elephants tooth, or as the fethers of a swan, as the tops of hills couered with daseling snow, as lawne, callecooe, or the finest Holland, washt and swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in cléere running water.

                  </gap>, a worde well agréeing to <hi>Aspasia</hi> for that property, she had a fine and a swéete toung, in so much that when she spake a man would haue auouched that he heard a <hi>Syren</hi> sing, for the vtterance of her voyce excelled the reuiuing sound of the wyre stryng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citerne: and yet, notwithstanding the premisses, she abhorred brauery, she passed not for pompe, pride she vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defied, gaynesse she set light by, curious apparel she contemned, to trim and painct out her selfe shee had no desire (for such costly prouision requireth large expences, and the maintenaunce therof a mountaine of money) as for her, she was but a poore mayden, her cofers were not ouercharged with coyne, sithence she was borne, bred, and brought vp vnder the winges of her poore parentes: and therfore had not to disburse and lay out largely in gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous ornamentes, to cast a misty cloude ouer mens eyes to iudge amisse of such suborned beuty.</p>
               <p>It fortuned vpon a time, that <hi>Aspasia</hi> was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the presence of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satis,</hi> the brother of <hi>Artexerxes,</hi> but sore against her will, and no lesse, likewise against her fathers minde, who was very loth to geue his consent thereunto: but being vrged to goe by compulsorie meanes, after which manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, they came by the constraint of the Kinge, his Péeres, and Nobles, when their cities were taken, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne, and subdued. One therfore of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Lordes amonge the rest, tooke vpon him to bring her before the Kings Maiestie, in the companye, and trayne of other young floureing damosels: vpon which generall presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (wherin there was such varietie of visages, such confusion of faire faces, such a selected troupe of <hi>Venus</hi> beutifull blossoms) Fortune did so fauour her, and her inestimable indowments so further her, that she was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the trim troupe of damosels, and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awaye the golden spurres of prayse from all that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176408:125"/> faire flocke. Which name of noblenesse she at that instant obtained for thrée seuerall qualities. <hi>Primo, propter integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem animi. Secundo, propter morum verecundiam. Tertio, propter carentem omni fuco pulchritudinem.</hi> First for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes of her minde, secondly, for her honest behauior, &amp; thirdly for her fairenes which was meere natural, and in no respect adulterine or counterfait. Moreouer, this was a singular helpe, that she grew and increased in the fauor and loue of the King, because wisedome had, as it were, taken vp an harbour or lodging in her humble hart, in so much that her deuises were precise, her studies singular and her policies péereles: for which causes <hi>Cyrus</hi> required her counsel in many matters, and disdained not to vse her aduise in ponderous and waighty affaires belonging to the common wealth. At the first time that <hi>Aspasia</hi> was presented before the kings person, he had but newly ended supper, and néedes would carrowse the cup after the custome of the <hi>Persians,</hi> (whose order was after meate, to haue a druncken compotation) and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they had packed, farsed, and stuffed their paun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with choyse of dishes before, yet must they fall to their bibbing and bouling immoderatly, wrestling with wine as it were with their enemie, of full intent and purpose, not to spare it till it were consumed, wasted, and spent. In the middest of this their superfluous quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, continued of custome and not required of necessitie, two couples of amiable maidens <hi>Graecians</hi> borne, were brought before the kinge, namely <hi>Cyrus,</hi> vnprofitably occupied at that instant and vndecently: of which foure <hi>Aspasia Phocensis</hi> was one, and they were brauely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, gorgeously decked, and set out after the finest and the trymmest fashion. For the other thrée damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells had their heary locks peckt, kempt, and spred in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the helping hands of certaine women being their friends, which also came vp with them: their faces were washed with oyle, fragrant oyntments, and swéete
<pb facs="tcp:176408:126"/> swéete smelling waters, that the orient sauor springing from their skinnes (as it were from a muske rose trée) might make them appeare more amiable. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so instructed and taught of their ouerséers, what behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our they shoulde vse before the presence of the Prince, and what maners might best beséeme them towardes his grace when occasion required: that they should not spare painted speach, that they should not shrink for deinty da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunce, that they should stande still in one place if he approched néere them, that they should not take it in dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon if he did touch and finger their faire skins and fine flesh: Finally that they should be liberall in kissing, and pay one for another.</p>
               <p>Thus were they furnished with the compleat harnesse of loue, which women commonly vse, as well to allure the hartes of men with their faire faces, as also to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase good will with their wanton qualities, in so much that one of these young damosels did contend &amp; striue w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> another, to surpasse and excell in beautye, brauery, and behauiour. As for <hi>Aspasia</hi> she was so far sequestred from this corrupt vsage, that she did vtterly abhorre and detest the same, séeing in a mirrour as it were, the mischefes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendinge thereupon and pondring all thinges in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launce of wisdom, perceaued what was conuenient, and what was séemely and decent. She would weare no gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous garment, no sumptuous apparell would shee put on, she wold not be sprinckled with cōpound waters, she would not be poudered with perfumes, but contemning all such vanity, wept, wailed, and made inuocation to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Gods, and the Gods <hi>Eleutherian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She cryed vpon the name of her father <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> and cast out wofull inuectiues against him and her selfe, as accursed wretches, borne vnder an vnfortunate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, for she thought the straunge and vnaccustomed train gowne which she was compelled to weare, to be a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest argument of seruitude, and the superfluous apparel
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176408:126"/> which she was forced to putt one, to be an euident token of bytter bondage. She resisted to weare such attire, till she was beaten, buffeted, and vncurteously intreated for her so dooing, and albeit she subscribed to the will of the noble man, whose office and peculier charge it was, to sée such things orderly done, and did yeald to his commaundement with a grudgeing and a repining stomack (as they might apparauntly perceaue) yet was she constrained to put that in practise, which became not a chast and vnspotted Virgine, but an impudent &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les strumpet. The other thrée young maidens (if they were such) entred into the priuy chamber of King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> beheld him boldly without blushing, smiled vppon him smoothely, and cast a venerious countenaunce vppō him, not respecting the celsitude &amp; highenes of his grace, nor regarding the homelynes and base estate of themselues. But <hi>Aspasia</hi> (who was also with them at the same time) looked downward to the ground, hanging her chin in her bosome (for her face was stayned with the crimson cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of shamfastnesse) &amp; from her eyes gushed fluds of salt teares: such were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> perturbatious of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> modest maidens minde. To be short, in al her behauiour and external ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which was aunswerable to the commotions of her hart) she shewed a certaine kinde of seemly bashfulnes, O how properly it béecame her person. Now when the king had viewed and reuiewed them with glauncing eyes, &amp; commaunded them all to syt downe about him, the other thrée damosels, without strayning courtesy, did as the kings maiesty bad them, &amp; tooke their seates with a great redynes. Onely <hi>Aspasia,</hi> gaue no eare to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> words of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or at least wise though she heard his voice, was very lothe in that pointe (considering her lowe degrée) to be obedient. But the noble man which presented her to the king wold not haue her so excused, but pulled her perforce and placed her in a conuenient roome. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had béen a while in this amorous company of damosels, whē
<pb facs="tcp:176408:127"/> he fealt &amp; fingred their softe fleshe, when he beheald their rowleing eyes, when he pleased him selfe with the sighte of their cherry cheekes, when he handled their longe and slender fingers, when he did what sensualities stinge prouoked him to practise, they let hym alone and gaue him leaue to dooe with their bodyes what he lyst. But <hi>Aspasia</hi> being impacient of such petulant and wanton demeanour, shriked and squeaked out when <hi>Cyrus</hi> offered to touche her after such an vnhoneste fashion, and sayd that if his Grace would not leaue such wanton dalliance, shee would make him beshrewe his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. As for <hi>Cyrus</hi> he was inclined to the greater disport, and procéeded further then he did before in so much that he was buisy to handle her silck softe, and milck white papps, wheruppon she being moued, arose suddenly out of her seate, and ranne awaye from him contrary to the custom of the <hi>Persians.</hi> Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> broyleing in loue, beganne to burne, or rather to flame in the fyer of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the bewty of <hi>Aspasia</hi> had not so much inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his hart, as her behauiour had bewitched the same. Anon <hi>Cyrus</hi> lookeing vppon the Noble man whiche bought and brought <hi>Aspasia</hi> to the Courte, sayde, <hi>Hanc solum ingenuam &amp; incorruptam adduxisti, Reliquae vero tam facie quam moribus sunt impostrices.</hi> This damosell whome thou hast presented vnto me is honest, blameles, vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; without blemishe: as for the other thrée, both their painted and starched faces, and their vnmodest manners betrayes them to be no better then harlots. And therfor did <hi>Cyrus</hi> plant his loue vppon her, more then he did vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other, with whom he had aquaintaunce and kept company. After y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> tyme, loue begaine to gather strenghte and tooke déepe roote in the harts of them both, insomuch that the swéet sapp of mutuall amity, dispersed and spred it selfe so abundantly, that the braunches of true loue beganne to budde and beare blossoms, yea at last yealded
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:176408:127"/> such fragrant frute, and therwithall so comfortable, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Aspasia</hi> waxed in a maner all one, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in all points and circumstaunces, to agrée and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the sober society of mariage, after the custom and trade of <hi>Grecia.</hi> This goodwill of king <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Aspasia</hi> was so manyfestly testifyed both by worde and by déede, that the fame therof dyd flye, not throughe <hi>Ionia</hi> alone, but also throughe out the whole region of <hi>Grecia:</hi> and <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> in semblable manner was replenished and filled with the same reporte. Furthermore Kinge <hi>Cyrus</hi> was enriched with this renowne besides, and this glory was added to his noblenesse, for it was thought and beléeued that he vsed the company of no woman, nether one nor other, but forsooke all his lemmans, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cubines, &amp; paramours, after he had gotten the loue of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasia,</hi> and obtained the body of so bewtifull and vertuous a damosell. Among al these alterations, chaunges &amp; chā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Aspasia</hi> remembred her dreame of the Pigeon, and recorded y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wordes which were vttered vnto her by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in her sléepe, and whatsoeuer ells was prophecyed by the lady of loue she called to memory: wherfor, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched with deuotion, to thintent she might séeme wel to deserue of so gracious a Godesse, procured a great image to be made, which she called by the name of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Venus,</hi> and caused the type and forme of a white Pigeon to be set next by it, which she decked with pearls and inriched with precious stones, offring sacrifices vnto <hi>Venus</hi> daily, beséeching her with prayers and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that she wold of her clemency cast the glymmering beames of beuty vppon her continually, and that she wold indure to be her fauorable mistres and louing lady that as she had wonne a certaine préeminent opinion of worship and estimation, so shee might by due desartes, kepe the same vndeminished, such was her noblenes of minde, and her vertuous inclination so incomparable.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176408:128"/>
               <p>Moreouer <hi>Aspasia</hi> was kindled with due consideration of her fathers <hi>Hermotimus</hi> pouerty, to whom she sent innumerable gifts, and presents of no small pryce and estimation, wherby of a pore man he was made rich, &amp; of one worth naught, he waxed opulent &amp; welthy. She was also very chast, sober, modest and continent, al the length of her lyfe, wherof the women, as well of <hi>Grecia,</hi> as also of <hi>Persia</hi> can giue sufficient testimony &amp; witnesse. There was sent to <hi>Cyrus</hi> from <hi>Scopas Iunior</hi> out of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> a Iewel of great value &amp; price, which was first sēt to <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pas</hi> out of <hi>Sicilia.</hi> This Iewel was wrought with wōder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful cunning, &amp; therin was variety of workmanship, in so much that euery one to whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> gaue a sight therof marueled not a litle at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worthines of the same. <hi>Cyrus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioycing in this Iewel out of measure, &amp; accompting ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of as of an inestimable treasure, went to <hi>Aspasia</hi> vpon a sodain, when the sunne was entred into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> South, whom he founde fast a sléepe in her bed chamber: then crept he closely vnder the couerlyd or carpett, and layed himself, downe by her with such silence &amp; quietnes, that in this his endeuour he procured vnto <hi>Aspasia</hi> no maner distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baunce in the world, but lay as stil as a lambe vntill she had ended her golden sléepe. when <hi>Aspasia</hi> awaked, and sawe <hi>Cyrus</hi> her swéete hart so nighe vnto her, she cast her armes abroade, and after her accustomed fashion of courtesy, embraced him louingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> takeing out of a caskett or boxe, the Iewell aboue mencyoned, shewed the same to <hi>Aspasia,</hi> saying, <hi>Hoc vel filia vel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre regia dignum donum est,</hi> This Iewell is worthy to be giuen to the daughter or mother of a Kinge: wherat <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasia</hi> beckned with her hed, as not dissalowing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> words of <hi>Cyrus: <hi>En, inquit, id tibi possidendum dono, tu vero cura vt e collo suspensum gestes.</hi>
                  </hi> Behold, sayth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kinge, I giue it vnto thée <hi>Aspasia</hi> to possesse, and to vse, kéepe it &amp; were it about thy lilly white necke. Nuertheles she did not receaue the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176408:128"/> Tablet at <hi>Cyrus</hi> handes, but aunswered his Maiesty in this sorte very prudently, discréetly and wisely, sayeing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Et quomodo ausim, cum hoc donum matrem tuam Parasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem, potius deceat? illi igitur mittito: Ego vero vel sine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento hoc, tibi collum satis venustum praestitero.</hi> Should I be so bold to weare such a princely Iewell, which is more méete for thy mother <hi>Parasatis?</hi> send it, I beséech thée, vnto her: As for me (O <hi>Cyrus</hi>) I hope to shewe vnto thée, a necke amiable and beutyfull enoughe, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this tablet be wanting. Thus (as is largely declared) <hi>Aspasia</hi> practised and accomplished with her policy, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wisdom, and counsell, things contrary, <hi>Et ex diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro pugnantia,</hi> and flat ouerthwart to the déeds of the rest of the kings wiues and concubines: and passed them as far in excellencie, as the Sunne dooth the Moone, as <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> gold doth rusty yron, as <hi>Indian</hi> pearles dooe grauell stones, as <hi>Spanish</hi> siluer dooth English leade, as the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe marygold doth the wilde wéede, finally as the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing dooth the worse: albeit they were supersyne and too too curious in trymming themselues, and more nyse then wise in all things to their attyre appertaining. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being singularly delighted with the sober an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers of <hi>Aspasia,</hi> and her commendable demeanour, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her still more outragiously, so that her wise words, and her faire déedes were vnto his hart, as oyle to a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neing lampe, and as séere wood to a scortching ouen. In this effectuall operation and working of loue, he wrote all the sayinges and dooinges of <hi>Aspasia</hi> methodically and orderly in a letter, which when he had ended, and sealed with his owne Signet, hee sent it vnto his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parasatis,</hi> and therwithall in a caskett or boxe, the Iewell or tablet, wherof mencyon so often was made before. After that the letter and the gifte were deliuered, the one perused, and the other vallued, <hi>Parasatis</hi> concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued greate ioye and gladnes in them both. But she was
<pb facs="tcp:176408:129"/> not so much delighted in the gifte sent vnto her by the meanes of <hi>Aspasia,</hi> as she was enamoured with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of the younge damosels courtesy: For which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations <hi>Parasatis</hi> the mother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> recompenced <hi>Aspasia</hi> with royall rewards and princely presents. The young woman (no doubt) was prudent and circumspect, For albeit she was so far admitted into the fauor of the kinge that all other were excluded, that others were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and contempned, yet thus she thought with her selfe secretly. In the sight of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the sonne, I am preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he exhibiteth that excellence of loue vnto me, wherunto none hath ability sufficient (as it séemeth) to aspire: neuertheles, I am not so hauty of hart, to think my self equall to <hi>Parasatis</hi> the mother, but acknoweledg my self (in comparison of her Gracious ladyship) a very vnderling. The presents and gifts which <hi>Parasatis</hi> sent vnto <hi>Aspasia,</hi> were glorious and vnualuable, yet did not she desire to possesse them, but praising the same, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing greate aduauncment vnto them for their inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable worthines, saide y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> she had no néede of such Iewels sythence she had of her owne store, both money and other precious treasures, which were giuen her franckly and fréely.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176408:129"/> was most amorous in face, so was she most vertuous in minde, and there was not halfe so much force in her heauenly hew, as there was grace in her noble nature. This woman (as you sée) with vertue adorned, to honour aduaunced, in fauour confirmed, shee was to the people an admiratiō, to the courteor a spectacle, to the Prince a singular delight, to none inferiour as touching good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, beyond all otherin gracious indouments, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and péerelesse in all respects, for her modesty, for her beuty, for her prudence, for her excellencie in all nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properties.</p>
               <p>In tract of time, it fortuned y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> in a foughten feeld against his brother was slaine, and his army discomfited by the force of the aduersary. <hi>Aspasia,</hi> in lyke maner, fell into the cruell clawes of the gréedy enemye, but <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> made diligent inquisition for her, vnderstāding her dexteritie in behauiour &amp; noblenes. Now when the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylesse souldiours brought her bound with halters lyke a prisoner and miserable abiect, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was angry out of measure thereat, and charged that the masters of the mischéefe should be imprisoned for their paines. Hee commaunded moreouer (after he had satisfyed his eyes with the sight of <hi>Aspasias</hi> beuty) that gorgeous garmēts should be geuen her to weare &amp; put on, which words whē she had no sooner hard, she refused all w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> sighings, sobings lamētatiōs, &amp; siluered teares trickling downe her chéeks, wherwith all her bosome was wet &amp; moystened, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these euident signes of a grudgeing sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, she was constrained to be clad w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rich robe which the king assigned &amp; gaue her, al this while she mourned &amp; sorrowed most bitterly for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> death of her déerely beloued <hi>Cyrus.</hi> When <hi>Aspasia</hi> had put on the apointed prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparell, there was not a woman more beutyfull to beholde throughout all the Borders of that Region: Then, loe, the forge of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> affections flamed,
<pb facs="tcp:176408:130"/> then, Lo, it sparckled, then, Lo, it was in an inextingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heate which might hardly be quenched, in so much that his hart fryeing in this fornace, languished and fainted with extreame loue: wherefore he estéemed more of her, then he did of all his wyues and concubines, and as she was chéefest and principall, so had she moste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vppon her, to her worship, honour, and renowne, by the benefite of her externall fauour which was ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, and her internall vertue, whiche was supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Thus dealt <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> with <hi>Aspasia,</hi> hopeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, and confidently persuading himself, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this was the only way to roote and race <hi>Cyrus</hi> out of the register of her remembraunce, and to conuert and turne her hart wholy, and soly vnto himselfe.</p>
               <p>But he sat beside the saddle (as the prouerbe sayth) and leaned besyde the cushing, immagining such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for her hart was so closely lincked and chayned to the hart of <hi>Cyrus</hi> whiles he liued, that nothing might sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse &amp; ouerwhelme the same when he was dead: sythēce the loue of him was ingrauen in the depth of her bowels, &amp; wrought in her, like a magical incantantion and witch craft, effects that were incureable. Not many dayes after this, <hi>Teridates</hi> the Eunuche, (who was the fairest youngman in all <hi>Asia,</hi> and the very floure of beutye in comparison of the rest, when he was past the state of a stripling, &amp; was newly planted in the pearle of his age, the softe heares springing about his chéekes, his chynne, and his lipps like soft wooll or fine downe, and his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bloud dispersed through his tender flesh, stayning his allabaster skynne with a crimsone colour) ended his life.</p>
               <p>This proper youth was the kyngs principall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and therfore did hée moste gréeuously, and pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye lament the losse of his lusty loue, and the gemme of his Ioy: besides that, there was a vniuersall sorrowe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176408:130"/> and a generall mourning throughout all <hi>Asia,</hi> euery one supposing that they exhibited good seruice and duty to the kings person, in pertaking his pensiuenesse, anguish, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and perplexity. No man durst be so bold as to come within the Princes presence, either to comforte his hart oppressed with heauinesse, or to mitigate and aswage the motions of his minde, considering that it did exceede all possibility to reclaime him from these perturbations, or to succour him in this grating agonie.</p>
               <p>After thrée dayes were expired and ouer passed, beuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Aspasia</hi> hauing on her mourning gowne, stoode in the way as the king should goe to the bath, wéeping way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, wringing her yuory handes, and looking downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the grownd as one dashed with tenne thousand doubtfull doumps: whom when the king behelde in that plainting plight, hee was abashed, his harte was griped with gréefe, and he demaunded the true occasion of her so sudaine comming vnto that place. To whom she sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this aunswer and sayde, <hi>Te, Rex, lugentem moerentem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que consolatum veni, si tibi sic visum esset: sin minus retrogre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diar.</hi> I come, O King, to minister consolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto thée, which lamentest so bitterly the death of thy late delight, if it may please thée to admit my goodwyll, and to accept my seruice: if not, as I am come hether, so am I content to returne. The king reioysing at the sober speach of <hi>Aspasia,</hi> bad her goe back agayne, and abide in her bedchamber till his comming, whose commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she fulfilled with great diligence, and no lesse du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience. When <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> returned from the bath, and founde <hi>Aspasia</hi> in the appointed place, he tooke the garment of <hi>Teridates</hi> the Eunuch, and put it on <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasias</hi> mourning gowne, and the young mans robe did in a manner fit her body, as if measure had bin taken to kéepe iust syze, in so much that the brightnesse of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and the glittering glasse of her coulour, appeared more gloryous in the presence of the kings maiesty then
<pb facs="tcp:176408:131"/> it was wont: for <hi>Aspasia</hi> by the wearing of that appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, represented the persō of the Eunuche whom <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> loued excéedingly, and within the same costly wéede was her owne body harboured, so that the gemination and coupling of these two seueral and singular benefits, ingendered delight in the hart of the King. Then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> declaring himself well pleased with that kinds of attire, which <hi>Aspasia</hi> at that instant had put on, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her swéetly and louingly, that she would vse his company oftentimes, in that sorte apparrelled, vntill the stormes and tempests of sorrowes, which were but latly and newly rysen, were alayd and ouer paste. To whose desire she shewed her selfe applyaunt to the vttermost of her ability, as one most willing to do his maiestie good. And she alone (all other exempted) comforted his Grace, asswaged, or rather soundly salued vp the sore of his harts heauinesse: for the which her kindnesse he behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe courteously vnto her, and framed himselfe to some lightnesse of spirit, and at length forgat all vexation and anguish. Thus did <hi>Aspasia</hi> performe and accomplishe that, which al the faire women in <hi>Asia</hi> besides, not al his sonns, nor any of his affinity and kinred could compasse by any maner of polisy and practise.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F <hi>Iasione Atalanta</hi> this brute is blased. When shee was borne, her father (not regarding her) forsooke her vtterly, defending his fact, with this bréefe and blunt saying, <hi>Non faeminis opus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo, sed viris,</hi> I haue no néede of womē, but of mē: sonnes I set by, but I care not for daughters. Howbeit the fellow to whom she was dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be made away, did not kill her, but being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with tendernesse, and kindled with compassion, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed her to the mountaine <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and laide her by a spring, wher was a gréene banck, a caue, &amp; a groue of oks: this hapened to her in the sucking yeares of her infancy. The childe was reiected, caste away, and appointed for the slaughter, howbeit it came to passe preposterously, her luck being louely, and her fortune fauourable, This to be true the euent, and successe of thinges evidently proue: For shortly after that the babe was left to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, a wilde beare, whom certaine huuntsmen had lately robbed of her whelps, hauing her dugs swolne, as it were, with aboundaunt increase of milk, raunged that way &amp; (as it came to passe, by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> inopinable prouidence of almighty God) was so far from deuouring the swéet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, that she delighted in it aboue all measure, gaue it suck most tenderly: whereby insued a mitigation of woe and gréefe to the heare, and sufficient sustentatiō to the
<pb facs="tcp:176408:153"/> prety babe which otherwise had béene comfortlesse: This Beare after shée had geuē sucke to the Childe, raū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about, to séeke her whelpes which were takē away, &amp; cōtinued her comming by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same place, where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> séely infāt lay, whome shée noursed, succoured, fostered, &amp; relée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with her milke, in stede of her owne whelps, whome (because shée had vnluckely lost) shée could not feede, and cherishe. The huntsmen (who had spoyled this beare of her younge) sought vpp hill &amp; downe dale for this beaste, to catch &amp; insnare her, that, as they had gotten y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whelps, so they might also haue the Damme: and as they were searcheing euery corner of the Groue of okes, where the Beare raunged (after her accustomed manner) through pasture plotts for sustenance, they happened vppon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talanta</hi> the Babe (whose name, at that tyme, was not <hi>Atalanta,</hi> for it was geuen her afterwardes by occasiō) and they carryed her away with them out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where shée lay desolate, and forsaken, to their owne habitations, and dwellings, bringing her vp among thē with such countrey fare, as with them was vsuall. In processe of tyme, when shée began to growe in stature, and increased in yeares (althoughe youthe be subiect to infinite infectiōs, and poisoned with innumerable pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enormities) yet shée (such were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gracious endowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of her modest minde) imbraced chastitie, abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the company of men, desired, and delighted to liue solitary, and the hills of <hi>Arcadia</hi> were her accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med walking places. Not farre from thēce (if I said w<seg rend="sup">c</seg>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same circuit or compasse I should not lye) there was a plaine plott of land, watered with braue brokes, and swéete springs, growne about wyth tall okes, open to the puffes and blasts of the whisking windes, &amp; ther was a woode of a notable thicknesse, and largenesse. Why should yt bée tedyous and wearysome to héere of <hi>Atalantas</hi> denne, as in <hi>Homer</hi> of <hi>Calipsus?</hi> in the bottō or valley wherof, was a certaine lōg caue, of a wōderful
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176408:153"/> profundity and depthe, the passage wherunto was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous, by reason of the fortifications and fences of stéepe and breaknecke bancks, the créeping Iuy grewe thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, wrapping the bodyes of the young trées, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plants, as yt were with armes, endeuouring to clyme vp to the very tops. There spronge yellowe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, in the plaine plott, I meane, and also in the wyld wood there flourished the floure deluce, and other flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of sundry sorts, and diuerse coulors, which did not only delight the eyes of the passingers, but did so season the spirable ayer with their swéete sauours, and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med smel, that the braines were abundantly comforted. And albeit they, by their fragrant, orient, aromaticall, and heauenly vertue, dispearsed a singular sollace, and a pleasure incomparable, to all the corporall senses and powers of the body, yet the sense of odoration or smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, peculiarly, and aboue the rest, was serued with plē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull delectation, Furthermore, there grewe goodly lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell trées, whose gréenenesse neuer vanished, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and kept colour without variation or chaunge, then which comfortable hew what might minister more recreation to the eye sight. Besides the aboue rehearsed pleasures, there grewe at the mouth, or entraunce of the caue (as it were in the forme, of arbours) vine trées both red and white, clustred with purple grapes, garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with gréene crangles about the braunches, &amp; deckt with indented leaues in all places, which offered many<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fest (that is somwhat more then probable) arguments and tokens, that <hi>Atalanta</hi> was not in subiection to ydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor yet vnfrutefully occupied. Furthermore there were cléere springs, whose running water resembled Christall, the holsome, and healthfull streame wherof was seruiceable, as well to drinke for the asswageing of thyrst, as also to washe, &amp; to bathe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flesh. These springs did afford speciall succour to such trées as grewe ny that plot of land, maintaining
<pb facs="tcp:176408:154"/> the lyfe of them with their comfortable moystenes, and preseruing the increase of sap with their excellent virtue. This princely pallace (for it was a peculier place, and, to say the truthe, péereles) as it was fytt, apt, and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for delectation, so was it not vnméete, for the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wisdom, learning, &amp; knowledge: and such a place was it, as therby was declared most euidently the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the young maiden, her dilligence, her art, excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, industrie, and painefullnes. She was more wise then nyce, (for she was nyce in no degrée) considering y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of her life, &amp; how shée counted want, welth: and skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity sufficient riches. For her bed, she had not the fine tyke stuffed with softe fethers, she had not blancketts of fusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or flannell, she had not couerlyds of costly tapestry, she had not shéetes of chosen Holland, she had not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of changeable sarsenet, she had not labells of glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering metall, she had not tassells of twysted silcke: but all such superfluity being put a parte and not so much as once thought vppon, she quieted her selfe with the hard hydes of brute beasts. As for her meat, it was not pigeon, plouer, partriche, nor phesaunt, it was not capon, quaile wodcok, nor herneshewe: it was not larke, sparrowe, bullfinche, rudock, nor black byrde: but it was fleashe of the forest, that was her ordinary diet. Her drincke was not cōpound with grapes or with graine: but simple, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, small, thynne, and without mixture, for it was the cléere running water of the riuer. And as for her appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, such was it, as became her proper person, her vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estate, and sober trade of lyfe: yea such, indéede, was it, as <hi>Diana</hi> her selfe was therwithall well pleased, and in no respect discontented. For she had this saying in her mouth, by often repetitiō, <hi>Tam in tenui &amp; inornato vestitu, quam in perpetua virginitatis conseruatione, Dianam imtari volo,</hi> I meane to imitate <hi>Diana,</hi> as well in playne and homely garments, as in the kéeping of perpetuall virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and maidenhed. This <hi>Atalanta,</hi> was by nature,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176408:154"/> swiftfooted, in so much that no wild beast was of power, strength, or abilyty to out run her, nor any man of might sufficient to insnare &amp; tangle her by traps, if she were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to fetch her ful course: Not only such therfor as saw her, but such also as heard of her by report, were kindled with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fier of affection to loue so worthy a maiden of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. But let vs procéede (if it séeme not troublsome) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe &amp; set forth, her beutyful fauour, &amp; other ornaments of the mind, which made her a mirrour to the multitude. And first of al, to begin at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wel hed, namely with her sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; bignes (when she was but a wench in comparisō of womās degrée) she surpassed all of the female sex, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally without exception: notwithstanding they had aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to maturitie of yeares, and fully attained to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rypnes of Age. As for her fauour, and comelynes (as well in proportion, as in complexion) no damosell in all <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> might be her match, her countenaunce was manlyke, and somwhat sower to beholde, the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherof, was her foode and sustenaunce, which was (as is before remēbred) the flesh of sauage &amp; vntamed beasts: she was stoute, sterne, valiaunt, victorious, couragious, and constant, she abandoned all wanton and insolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercises, shée did not addict, conforme, and apply her selfe to the company of women and wenches, to follow their practises in the hils which she haunted, she kept her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed closset, and chamber vsuall, she was not of their number to whom the mothers haue geuen sucke, or the nources milke and pappe, she was not cumbred with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous fattnes of fleshe, and why? because she kept her body within the limits of measurable quantitie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different substaunce, by Hunting, and semblable excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of actiuenes &amp; moueing: her haire was yellowe, but not by any extraordinary meanes, (as many women vse to coulour their locks) not with stayning Lye, not w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> trumpery oinctments, nor any such ylfauoured slabber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauces: but her vissage being couloured with the beutifull
<pb facs="tcp:176408:155"/> beames of the glorious sunne, glittered more cleare and bright then gold, siluer, or any other metall or minerall. What floure in the feeld or the garden, is so faire, so fyne, &amp; so fragrant as the face of a pure and vnblemished vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin shining with shamefastnes? There were in <hi>Atalanta</hi> twoo qualities, which moued men to admire and woonder her countenance of maiesty, &amp; wel proportioned making, feare also and terror which her grim lookes did strike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of the beholders: No white liuerd or Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly Lurdane might loue her seeing her frowning face, no cowardely turneback, might abide to behold her: ther was such a brightnes yoked with her beuty, that they both, lincked together, blinded the eyes of the lookers on. Many things made people meruaile at her, &amp; principally, this, for that she came seldom in sight: for she did not offer her selfe of set purpose to be viewed of any man, but vpon occasion, whē she was chasing some wild beast, or taking reuengment vpon one or other with sodain &amp; sharp force, then appéered she to such as were within the compasse of the ground, wher she was to be séene like a sparkling starre, or rather, like a flashe of lightening, clattering out of a cloude: after which appearaunce she vanished with suddaine motion, like an Arrowe out of a Bowe, and hid herself among the thick Okes in the gréene Groue, or els in som vally, and shadowed secret angle. It fortuned that two youngmen of the country bordering hard by, whose names were <hi>Hylaeus,</hi> and <hi>Rhoecus</hi> both <hi>Centaures,</hi> two presumptuous companions, &amp; inclined to lechery &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, resorted to the caue or denne of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> about midnight, hoping (as it might be suspected) to obtain such grace and fauour at her hands, as they themselues would wishe and desire. These twoo lusty blouds, in this their louely enterprise, vsed no Musicians or any thinge els which youngmen were accustomed vnto, in the City, but they had flaming torches with them, which cast a glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:176408:155"/> lighte, at the shineing sier whereof, the people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, quaked for feare, <hi>Atalanta</hi> only excepted. Then, Lo, did they stripp the pinetrées of their braunches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they made wreathes, and garlands, adorning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therwithall, and running vp hill and downe dale with a continuall clattering noyse of weapons, burning vp trées in their passage towardes the maydens mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, moste iniuriously: She, not ignorant of their intent (for she spyed the flickering flames throughe a clyfte, or rifte) and knowing very well what fantasticall, fonde, and furious fellowes they were, was neuer a whit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, nor once chaunged her countenaunce (a sensible argument of a minde frée from commotions) but bent her bowe tightly, drewe it strongly, and leuelled a sharpe arrow at one of them, wherwithall he was so wounded, that immediatly followed an ineuitable faintnes of all the limmes and members, in so much that his feete faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred vnder the burthen of his body, and downe he fell to the grounde, as to much inféebled, to succour himselfe. The other companion, perceauing what was done, laide loue aside, and turned his study a contrarie waye, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wooing wordes, and beetoke him to woundinge weapons, as one precisely purposed, and absolutly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, to take present and vndeferred reuengment, of his companions destruction. Whiles he was harnessing him selfe to those practises of hostilitie, and sought to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished compleatly with force of furiousnesse, <hi>Atalanta</hi> discharged a swift, and a sharpe headed flighte at him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which wroughte in him semblable &amp; sodaine dispatch, in all respects, as it did in his partener. And thus much of <hi>Atalanta Iasione,</hi> at this instant, suppose I sufficient, wherin (as in a mirour, and a cleere looking glasse) we may behold the natiuitie and byrthe, the education and bringing vp, the practises and behauiour, to be short, the comendable course of the lyfe of <hi>Atalanta.</hi>

It fortuned vpon a time, that a certaine soiourner lodged at his house, and committed to his credit, a certaine sum of money in golde, This <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careus,</hi> being assaulted with auarice, and caryed as it were into captiuitie to couetousnesse, makes a hole w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> a mattock, in a secret place of the temple, and therein hides the golde, where with he was put in truste: after a fewe dayes were expired, the soiourner desired to haue his owne, vpon which request <hi>Macareus</hi> led the man (mist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting no mischéefe, nor doubting any daunger) into the temple, vnder a pretence, cloke, and colour, to restore the man his right, and hauing (as he thought) oportunitie of time and place, to worke his villanie, murthered the man: which being compassed to his contentation, he tooke vp the golde, and layd the right owner thereof (whom he had iniuriously slayne) in the selfe same place, couered him ouer with earth, and damd vp the pit in such sort as althings (in his thinking) were cock sure, perswading him selfe that, as men be deceiued &amp; mocked, so the powers su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernall (the eternall Gods I meane) might be deluded, and blinded.

But this commandement of the king, as it séemed to restraine necessitie (for talke and conference is naturall and may not so straightly be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited) so it was soone violated, infringed and broken. Howbeit, not with manyfeste tokens, but with secret signes of the senses, made one to another, one while of the face looking sowrely, stearnly, sorrowfully, merely, &amp;c. another while of the handes and fingers bent this way and that way importing many mysteries, and semblably of other senses, whereby one certefied ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their meanings &amp; determinations.

Wherefore he made a newe lawe beside the former, which did abrogate the libertie of vseing such signes as are before mencioned.

Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon word was carried to the king, that no man vsed to
<pb facs="tcp:176408:179"/> speake by signes, but that all priuie and secret tokens of countenaunce, all mistical motions of bodely members, and all other semblable significations (whereby his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes did communicate the conceipts of their molested mindes) were vtterly lefte, and that those their former fashions, and trade of behauiour, was turned into a v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall and straunge kinde of lamentation: vpon the reporte of which tidings, the king (fearing still that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniēce, which faine he wold haue cut of, &amp; could not) maketh preparatiō, &amp; (w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as much spéede as he might by any possibility) setteth forward one foot, w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> a traine of his guarde and Pēsioners: intending to suppresse this inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vnaccoustomed kinde of spectacle: Howbeit, the people (whō the present perturbations of their intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable subiection pricked) gathered together in a flock, &amp; espying a farre of, a certaine glimmering shew of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king and his traine, made themselues ready to rebell against his person, and first of all encountred his assistauntes, from whom they violently wroonge their weapons, and by that meanes left them vnmunified and naked: and bending the fulnesse of their force against the Tyraunt, hackt and hewde him in péeces.
